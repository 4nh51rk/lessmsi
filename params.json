This has been used in automated scripts to extract files or information from an MSI. To extract from the command line:\r\n\r\n     lessmsi x <msiFileName> [<outouptDir>]\r\n\r\nFor more information on command line usage see [the Command Line documentation](https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi/wiki/Command-Line).\r\n\r\nAdditional Features\r\n==========\r\nWindows Explorer Integration\r\n-----\r\nLessmsi also integrates with Windows Explorer so that you can right-click on a Windows Installer file (.msi file) and select \"Extract Files\" to extract it into a folder right there:\r\n\r\n![lessmsi Explorer Integration screenshot](https://raw.github.com/activescott/lessmsi/master/misc/screenshot-explorerintegration.png)\r\n\r\nJust select _Preferences_ from the _Edit_ menu to enable (or disable) the explorer integration:\r\n\r\n![lessmsi Preferences Dialog screenshot](https://raw.github.com/activescott/lessmsi/master/misc/screenshot-preferences.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMSI Table Viewer\r\n-----\r\nWindows Installer (.msi files) are based on an internal database of tables. Lessmsi features a viewer for those tables.
